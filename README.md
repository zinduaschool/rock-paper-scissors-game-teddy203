# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

- In this project, you will be building a rock paper scissors game using JavaScript. The game will involve two players who will each select one of three options - rock, paper, or scissors - and the winner will be determined by a set of rules that you will create. This project is designed to help you gain proficiency in JavaScript programming and apply your knowledge to a practical project.

## Requirements:
Your rock paper scissors game should have the following features:

1. A user interface that allows the players to select their choices
2. A set of rules that determine the winner of each round
3. A mechanism for keeping score of the game
4. A reset button to start a new game
5. The game should be able to run in a web browser

## Instructions:

1. Create a HTML file with a basic structure, including a title, header, and main content area.
2. Create a CSS file to style the HTML elements and make the interface look presentable.
3. Create a JavaScript file to handle the game logic, including user input, determining the winner, keeping score, and resetting the game.
4. Write functions to handle the user input and compare the choices to determine the winner.
5. Implement a scoring mechanism to keep track of the number of wins for each player.
6. Use event listeners to respond to user actions, such as selecting a choice or resetting the game.
7. Test your game thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected and that all requirements have been met.

## Deliverables:

1. A working rock paper scissors game that runs in a web browser and meets all requirements.
2. Code files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that are well-organized, well-documented, and free from errors.
3. A brief report outlining the design and implementation of your game, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.

## Assessment Criteria:
Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:

1. Functionality: Does the game work as expected, and does it meet all requirements?
2. Code quality: Is the code well-organized, well-documented, and easy to read and understand?
3. Creativity: Does the game demonstrate creativity and originality in its design and implementation?
4. Presentation: Is the game visually appealing, with an intuitive and user-friendly interface?
